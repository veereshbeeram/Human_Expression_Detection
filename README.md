Human_Expression_Detection
==========================

program to analyze images and detect expressions in them.

The expressions are trained using MultiLayer Perceptron neural network, sample implementation available at: http://www.ncorpus.com/aydingurel/

To run this program you will need:
* OpenCV installation
* Python & wxPython GUI toolkit
* Set of sample images

on compiliation, ImageProcessing.c gives you a program that generates a set of normalized datapoints for each image, These datapoints can be used to train neural network of your choice.

A report is included in report folder, that describes the project.
